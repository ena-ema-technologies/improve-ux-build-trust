# 🛒 Cart UX Redesign – UI/UX Design Task

## 📌 Task Overview

This task is part of our UI/UX designer hiring process. You’ll be redesigning a **mobile-first shopping cart experience** for an e-commerce store that sells **premium food products** such as dried dates and peanuts.

We've included a sample of current checkout processes to help you visualize the flow and identify improvement areas.

The core challenge: Many **first-time users** abandon their cart — likely due to higher product pricing and lack of brand familiarity. Your job is to design a cart interface that increases **trust** and encourages **conversion**, especially for **mobile** users.

## 🧠 Context

- **Store Type:** Premium, luxury food brand
- **User Type:** First-time visitors on **Mobile & Desktop**
- **Problem:** Cart abandonment due to pricing concerns and trust gaps
- **Your Focus:** Show why the product is _worth_ the price, and help users feel confident in completing their order

## 🎯 Objective

Design a cart experience that:

- Works seamlessly on **mobile-first** (desktop support is a bonus)
- Builds **trust** in product quality and the brand
- Encourages users to **complete their purchase**
- Clearly communicates the **value**, even at a higher price point

## ✅ Requirements

### Must Include:

- An **empty cart state** design
- **Checkout CTA** (Call to Action)
- **Product summary** (name, quantity, price, total)
- **Trust-building elements** (e.g., badges, return policy, user ratings)
- **Payment options** (Instant Payment, Cash on Delivery)

### Optional (Bonus Points):

- “**Save for Later**” or **Wishlist** feature
- **Micro-interactions** (e.g., confirmation toast after quantity change)
- **Smart nudges** (e.g., “Only 2 left in stock”, “Free shipping available”)

## 📦 Deliverables

- A **Figma file** (mobile-first layout required)
- A short **design rationale** (3–5 bullet points):
  - Why you made certain design decisions
  - How you tried to build **user trust**
  - How your design addresses **cart abandonment**

## ⏱ Deadline

Please complete and submit your design by **11:59 PM, 26th June**.

Send your submission to:  
📧 **enaematechnologies@gmail.com**

We’re excited to see how you think and design!
