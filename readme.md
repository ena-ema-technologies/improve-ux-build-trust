- Empty cart state design
- Checkout CTA (Call to Action)
- Product summary (name, quantity, price, total)

- Payment options (e.g., Instant Payment, Cash on Delivery)

### Optional but Appreciated:

- "Save for Later" or wishlist option
- Micro-interactions or hints (e.g., confirmation toast)
- Smart nudges (e.g., "Only 2 left in stock", "Fast shipping")

## Context
